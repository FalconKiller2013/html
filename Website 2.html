        <h3>Ferrari-F80</h3>
        <p>The F80 uses a hybrid powertrain, consisting of a 3.0L twin-turbocharged Tipo F163 CF 120° V6 petrol engine derived from the Ferrari 499P, and three electric motors.</p>

        <h3>Aston Martin Valkyrie AMR PRO</h3>
        <P>The AMR Pro uses the same 6.5-litre naturally-aspirated V12 engine as used in the Valkyrie road car without the KERS system. The engine will also be modified, which means the AMR Pro will have up to 820 kW (1,100 hp)(estimated 870–970 kW (1,160–1,300 hp)); which is more than its road-legal counterpart.</P>
